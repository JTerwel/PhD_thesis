The top panel shows the late-time spectrum obtained on 26 July 2023 using OSIRIS+ on the GTC, and the SDSS spectrum obtained in 2003. The bottom panel shows the late-time excess, obtained by subtracting the SDSS host galaxy spectrum from the observed late-time spectrum. A smoothed spectrum is shown in blue. The smoothing was done using a rolling kernel of size 5 to average over the values. The red lines are a simple TDE model with Milky Way and some amount of host galaxy extinction applied (the amount is shown in the legend), in order to get the approximate shape of the observed spectrum. Narrow emission and absorption lines that were notable in the unsubtracted spectrum are marked with dashed lines. The grey regions are affected by sky lines, and should be ignored. The late-time spectrum of SN 2020alm is available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to \url  {cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr} (130.79.128.5), via \url  {http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/ }or upon request to me.}}{78}{figure.caption.32}\protected@file@percent }
