A normal radioactive decay model was fitted to these tails, shown as solid straight lines with their $1\sigma $ uncertainty as dashed regions. But as the ejecta opacity changes over time so does the half-life time of the tail, causing a kink seen in the bins which is not reproduced by the model. The arbitrarily normalised \textit {R}-band light curve of SN 2011fe (known not to have CSM interaction from detailed spectral studies) \citep {spec_Lijiang-2.4m} is shown in blue, showing the same shift in decline slope at a similar phase}{figure.caption.20}{}}

The bottom panel shows the late-time excess, obtained by subtracting the SDSS host galaxy spectrum from the observed late-time spectrum. A smoothed spectrum is shown in blue.
