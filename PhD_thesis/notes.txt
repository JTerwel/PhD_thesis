This file is for making personal notes. It will not be used when compiling the thesis

Main style version adapted from Pearse Murphy (https://github.com/murphp30/thesis/tree/main), a previous PhD student from Trinity who got it from others before him. To whoever uses my version in the future as a base model, please take advantage of it, keep spreading it to the next person afterwards, and above all enjoy the process.

To add a section to the full thesis do something like: \include{chapter_1/introduction}

back referencing from tables and figures should be taken care of automatically, just add [...name...] to the caption to name it in the list of figures / tables

To make chapters compilable without compiling everything (makes stuff faster, but format changes slightly) the chapter files need to look like this (check https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Multi-file_LaTeX_projects):
%!TEX root = ../main.tex
\documentclass[a4paper,oneside,12pt, class=Latex/Classes/PhDthesisPSnPDF, crop=false]{standalone}
\usepackage{setspace}
\begin{document}
\doublespacing
\chapter{...chapter name...}
\label{...chapter label...}
...text...
\end{document}

NOTE:
' ' = Planned but still to be written
'v' = Good version ready
'V' = Completely done, ready for thesis submission
'w' = (partially) Written, but needs proper edit / extention
'm' = Paper version exists, needs editing
'P' = Paper version exists, paper at or beyond submission stage
'X' = Scrapped section, but has info here that's still needed

NOTE: send 1st draft by 20-9
NOTE: List of publications: All papers except the master-related one that I am on, title + reference

% THESIS PLAN & LAYOUT %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

|- Chapter 1: Introduction (Adapt from paper intros)
| V |- Section 1: The final stages of stars
|   |        General introduction to stellar remnants & SNe
| V |- Section 2: Type Ia SNe
|   |        Type Ia in general & subclasses, introduce progenitor problem
| V |- Section 3: The Ia-CSM subclass
|   |        Ia-CSM in general, SN 2015cp & late interaction,
|   |        systematic blind spot for late interactions, define aim of the search
|
|- Chapter 2: Observing in the optical regime (ONLY ADD WHAT IS USED IN PAPERS!!!)
| V |- Section 1: Telescopes (ZTF, NOT, GTC, others used throughout the thesis)
| V |- Section 2: General considerations (Loc, tel, inst, det)
| V |- Section 3: Image types (includes calibrations)
|   |             Keep to only to phot / spec
|   |             (pol used as example above but not used so no explanation needed)
| V |- Section 4: Reduction (Use calibs from above and explain step by step why)
| V |- Section 5: Forced photometry (FPbot uses psf, and mention difference imaging)
| 
|- Chapter 3: A systematic search for late-time rebrightening
|   |           Short introduction Add that section X has been extended
| V |- Paper 1: Add with as little editing as possible
| V     |- Section X: SNAP section, add a snapshot of SNAP
|
|- Chapter 4: ZTF observed late-time signals of pre-ZTF transients
| V |- Paper 2: Add as late as possible after feedback from submission process
|
|- Chapter 5: A real-time search for Type Ia SNe with late-time CSM interaction in
|             ZTF
| V |- Paper 3: Won't be ready in time, adapt directly to thesis
|               SN 2019zbq: Is it possible to make a host lc to check?
|
|- Chapter 6: The next steps
| V |        Future research to build from this (LSST, other samples)
| V |        Alternative uses for a pipeline like this (ANT search in nuclei?)
| V |        Pipeline improvements (Validation check for ANTs if nucleus close)
| V |        non-pipeline related future research



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% To-do list %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

V Write abstract (1-2 pages)
V Write dedication
V Figure out what exact name to put on the cover
V Write acknowledgement (1 page)
V Add references and do a final rewrite of the Observing chapter
V Check for any left red text and fix them
V Check chapter introductions and fix them if needed
V Spell-check (carefully and rigorously)
V search for the obvious ‘the the’ and check definitions (SN, ZTF) are only defined once per chapter etc.
V Make sure all citations work properly
V Check for double citations and fix
V Check for any other broken links / references etc.
V Make sure that the LateX errors and warnings are for nothing important
V Check with TCD style guide that everything is correct
V Fix layout for each chapter
V Final read for last checks
