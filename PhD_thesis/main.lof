Targets are plotted with their altidute as a function of universal standard time and local stellar time on top. The target priority has been colour coded, with the coloured bars showing the amount of time each observation is expected to take. Green targets have already been completed, and the red vertical line shows the current time. Not all targets fit into the schedule but are still shown in case the plan has to be ammended during the night.\color {red} Temp version, find and make a proper one \color {black}}}{9}{figure.caption.8}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.3}{\ignorespaces Image and partial spectrum of SN 2024nqr (left) and SN 2024pgd (right), two SNe Ia active simultaniously in the same galaxy. The image was taken without a filter and used to align the 1.0$^{\prime \prime }$ slit (horizontal dashed lines) over both SNe. The resulting spectrum, taken with grism \#4, shows three traces as white vertical stripes. The outer two line up with the two SNe, while the middle trace is from the host galaxy edge in the slit (vertical dotted lines for guidance). The horizontal lines in the spectrum are sky lines coming from atmospheric emission. This data was taken with NOT/ALFOSC on the night of 28 July 2024 while testing an experimental rapid response mode (RRM, credit: Samuel Grund S\o rensen). \color {red}check AT/SN status weirdness \color {black}}}{11}{figure.caption.9}%
