\section{Type Ia SNe}
\color{red}Somewhere state that while I focus on interaction in SNe Ia, this search can be broadened, as is done in paper II \color{black}

To convert between apparent and absolute magnitude I assume a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_\text{m} = 0.310$ \citep{Planck18VI} throughout this paper, unless specified otherwise. \color{red} Do I use another one anywhere? \color{black}
